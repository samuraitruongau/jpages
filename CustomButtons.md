## Custom Buttons
In case you would like to use a custom element as a button you can pass the selector for that element and it will be used instead of the auto generated one.

Keep in mind that if the plugin does n0t find at least one element for that selector it will think that you're passing the label for the button, so make sure that element exists. You can use more than one element for each button if you want.

This might be really helpful if you're trying to build something like a slider or a gallery because you don't have to spend time styling the generated links and getting them out of the nav. You can design everything in your own way and then you just have to pass the selector of the elements you want to use as arrows to jPages and it will do the rest.
