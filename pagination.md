# Pagination

jPages gives you a lot of options to customize your pages and also the way the nav looks and works. You can choose the number of items per page, start page, start range, middle range and end range. If you're not familiar with this terms you can read more about them here.

Note that you have to be somehow careful when you chose these parameters values. For instance, you won't set the start page to be the the 15th if you're just expecting 10 pages.
